## The Inter-Fork Collaboration Directory, a Decentralists DAO initiative

Today, there are thousands of forks of Cosmos tech (Cosmos SDK, Tendermint Core, Gaia, and Interchain Standards) and 175+ Cosmos chain validators. Navigating the ecosystem in search of active projects and developers is a challenge, especially if you don’t have a personal contact to guide you. The Inter-Fork Collaboration directory is an initiative to be that guide: 
to make it easier for existing projects and newcomers to identify collaborators
find development synergies and implementations
make introductions to potential partners and overall get plugged into the ecosystem 

There are additional benefits to participating in the Inter-Fork Collaboration directory that apply to active projects, validators, and contributors working in the space. 

## Why does Cosmos need an ecosystem directory?

1. An inclusive and accessible ecosystem
   - An inclusive and accessible ecosystem isn’t about needing a personal contact, being a legacy contributor, or spending hours researching forked repos, contributors, Discord, and websites. It’s about making Cosmos easier for new developers and projects to get connected and find partnerships and engineering support. The ecosystem will benefit if we all support one another; this has been one of the reasons behind Cosmos’ success with developers and builders. 
2. The expansive technology stack
   - The Cosmos technology stack has boomed since the original few repos (Tendermint Core, Cosmos SDK, and Gaia). Now there are IBC, ICS, CosmWasm, CosmJS, and more. In an ideal world, having a directory that lets people see a holistic view of the Cosmos stack an active project is using and how, in addition to what they are modifying in the fork, offers a wealth of information to teams working on the core tech and makes the open source community thrive. The usage feedback loop is critical.
3. Support active projects and contributors 
   - The open source community is constantly challenged with the tragedy of the commons. The technology is being used, but with little given back in the way of improvements, upgrades, and technical maintenance. It’s important to identify, highlight, and reward teams and contributors that push changes upstream. 
4. Security and troubleshooting 
   - A challenge every core tech team within Cosmos has struggled with is security reporting and upgrades. Security and auditing are done at the expense of an organization, but bug bounty programs and overall security reporting are essential to keeping up the standards of the tech for everyone. Security issues are often not reported to the original team, causing reputational damage or harm to its users, not to mention given the different versions used - a security issue could be only applicable to that specific version. 

The Inter-Fork Collaboration directory is a Decentralists DAO initiative that encourages the developer community to make access to information and engineering work easier and more personal. If you answer yes to these questions, then submit a pull request and add the information to the directory. 

* Did you start your project using Cosmos technology?
* Did you get support from the Cosmos community?
* Have you benefited from Cosmos technology?
* Do you care about the quality of the technology and open source community?
* Do you want to support the growth of the developer community?
* Do you want a collaborative space that flourishes from transparent knowledge sharing?
